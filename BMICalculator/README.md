# BMI Calculator App

BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness  based on their height and weight, and is 
intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely used as a 
general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body 
weight for their height. Specifically, the value obtained
from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether 
a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, 
or obese depending on what range the value falls between.
